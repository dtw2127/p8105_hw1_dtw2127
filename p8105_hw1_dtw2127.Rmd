Problem 1

Creating vectors. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

random_sample = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1)
logical_vector = random_sample > 0
character_vector = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f","g","h","i","j")
factor_vector = c(-1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1)
factor_vector = factor(factor_vector, levels = c(-1,0,1))

```
